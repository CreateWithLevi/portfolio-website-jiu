title: Between Shadows
description: "Between Shadows is an interactive motion experiment built in Rive, exploring how digital gestures can feel human. Through rigging and subtle triggers, it brings light, shadow, and motion together in quiet conversationâ€”capturing the fragile, living quality of movement in digital space."
